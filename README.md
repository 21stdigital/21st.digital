## Git LFS

This repository uses Git Large File Storage (LFS) for managing large files in the `public/assets` directory. The `git lfs` extension is required to handle these files properly.

### Installing Git LFS

To install Git LFS, visit [https://git-lfs.com/](https://git-lfs.com/) for detailed instructions. For macOS users, it is recommended to install Git LFS via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git-lfs
```

### Setting Up Git LFS

After installation, you need to set up Git LFS for your user account:

```bash
git lfs install
```

This setup only needs to be done once per user account.
